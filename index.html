						<div class="title">
							<b>STORYMODE</b>
							<br/>
							A game about Crafting
						</div>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Join our human adventurer on an adventure! Is this adventurer even a hero? Is he even actually an adventurer?  Who cares? Not the <i>Crafting Goddess Joann</i>, apparently! All she wants is a slave to make crap for her, and that slave appears to be this poor soul. I guess now that he's been chosen by a trans-dimensional entity to do some kind of bidding he doesn't really have a choice of sorts.
					</p>
					<p>At least
						there's some fun to be had as he traverses the dungeons generated from your old high-school reports and porn collections.
					</p>
					<p>
						<center>
							Wait a second, did I just say <b><i>old high-school reports</i></b>?!
							They have value now?
							<br/>You sure bet!
						</center>
						<br/>
						You'll have to delve deep into your hard drive's dungeons to create the list of items the goddess has bestowed upon you to create.  All the dungeons are 
						randomly generated from the files that you select on your hard drive, with bigger files creating bigger dungeons, and different file 
						types designating different kinds of loot you can find.  Even item, crafting, and monsters have generated names with randomly selected 
						comedic, and occasionally relatively offensive, adjectives attached.  Even the requirements to make the crafted items are random!  
						Who cares if any of this makes sense?!  Obviously not the guy who developed the game!
					</p>
					<p>
						StoryMode is a parody rogue-like made with original planned development time lasting a week in order to
						show a demo at TooManyGames 2014 in Philadelphia, PA.  I describe it as a traditional rogue-like that takes the well-known 
						randomness of the genre and cranks it to 11!
